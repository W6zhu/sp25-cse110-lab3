Note: W3 Validation threw errors for the use of the following. However the color usage was allowed by the lab as well as noted in official documentation. 
```
color(colorspace c1 c2 c3[ / A])     /* predefined color space, values for color space*/

color-mix(method, color1[ p1], color2[ p2])   /*method to mix colors, values & percentages of color*/
```
The validation tool also threw errors for nested selectors, but such issues were ignored as noted by the lab document.
